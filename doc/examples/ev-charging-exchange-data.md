# Electric Vehicle Charging Exchange Data

## Overview

There are many options for integrating the BSM-WS36A into electric vehicle
charging infrastructure. It facilitates this by providing signed data in two
output formats:

1. Its [proprietary snapshot format](snapshots.md)
    - Where the actually signed data is based on an [abstract
      representation](snapshots.md#verifying-a-snapshot-with-the-bsm-tool)
      snapshot data
    - Allowing to translate snapshot data in other forms where the abstract
      representation could be reconstructed from
    - Allows passing on signed data in a variety of derived formats
2. [OCMF](ocmf.md)
    - Derived from the former
    - "Signed as seen" and therefor with an individual signature
    - Passed on literally until verification

The BSM-WS36A is already integrated with chargeIT mobility's solutions
(charging controller, backend, frontend, and Chargy for validation) and easily
integrates with others.

There are multiple paths from signed data generated by the BSM-WS36A and the
customer validating it. The diagram shows the involved data formats as
parallelograms: the ones with an orange background are shown and discussed in
these examples while the gray ones are shown here just to sketch furthermore
possible formats.

The paths discussed are towards the following two applications for validating
charging data using a so-called Transparenzsoftware:

1. Chargy
    - Validates Chargy, OCMF, ...
    - [Certified
      release](https://www.chargeit-mobility.com/wissen-tipps/validierung/)
      which does not include validating signed data from BSM-WS36A yet
    - [Pre-release](https://github.com/chargeITmobility/ChargyDesktopApp/releases)
      supporting the BSM-WS36A which currently undergoes certification

2. [S.A.F.E. Transparenzsoftware](https://www.safe-ev.de/de/transparenzsoftware.php)
    - Validates OCMF, ...

As sketched out in the diagram, there are more solutions available and possible
for validating charging data.


## Chargy JSON and Custom Formats

For validating charging data with Chargy, chargeIT mobility's solutions take
the following steps shown below. These are also a blueprint for defining and
using custom formats along this path. These steps are:

- Charging station
    - The controller [creates](snapshots.md#snapshot-creation) snapshots and
      [fetches their data](snapshots.md#snapshot-data)
    - It converts snapshot data into [Chargy's snapshot data JSON
      format](chargy.md#snapshot-data)
    - It sends this format via OCPP to chargeIT's backend

- Backend and frontend
    - Receive and handles snapshot data for a charging process in [Chargy's
      snapshot data JSON format](chargy.md#snapshot-objects)
    - Generate [Chargy JSON data](chargy.md#chargy-json-format) from the
      individual snapshot data and its information about the charge point
    - Provide the latter to the customer (for example as download via its web
      UI)

- Customer
    - Copies charging data from the frontend and pastes it into Chargy for
      validation
    - Or downloads charging data from the frontend, stores it, and opens the
      files with Chargy.

Or to phrase it more technically - this data path consists of:

- [Converting BSM-WS36A snapshot data into a custom transport
  format](chargy.md#snapshot-data) which allows to reconstruct the abstract
  representation of the signed data
- Combining and augmenting this data into [Chargy JSON
  data](chargy.md#chargy-json-format)
- Validating Chargy JSON data
    - Reconstructing the [abstract
      representation](chargy.md#verifying-a-snapshot-with-the-bsm-tool) as
      shown by example in [Abstract Data Representation
      Example](chargy.md#abstract-data-representation-example)
    - Validating the signature for the abstract data representation
    - Performing [consistency checks](chargy.md#signature-verification)


## OCMF

In contrast to the abstract data representation used by BSM-WS36A's snapshots,
in OCMF the concrete data representation gets signed and requires passing along
this data literally along the path. So the steps here are:

- Charging station
    - The controller [creates](snapshots.md#snapshot-creation) snapshots and
      [fetches their OCMF
      respresentation](ocmf.md#getting-the-ocmf-representation)
    - I directly passes the OCMF data to a backend

- Backend and frontend
    - Receive and handles snapshot data in OCMF format
    - Assemble [OCMF XML data](ocmf.md#ocmf-xml) from the individual snapshots
      and provide it to the customer

- Customer
    - Downloads charging data from the frontend, stores it, and opens the file
      with the S.A.F.E. Transparenzsoftware

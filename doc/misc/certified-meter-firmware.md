# Overview Certified Meter Firmware Releases

# Overview

The BSM-WS36A-H01-1311-0000 provides firmware information for its meter and
communication module separately. They have individual controllers and are
therefor running individual firmware.

Information about the firmware running on these controllers is provided in two
ways:

- At the meter's display, at different views
    - Meter module firmware info at _Software Version_
    - Communication module firmware info at _Meter Address_/_ZÃ¤hleradresse_
      cycling through the following pieces
        - The first four digits of the firmware revision prefixed with `F0`
        - The first eight digits of the firmware hash prefixed with `F1` and
          `F2`

- Via its Modbus interface where it could be read from three different data
  points
    - The meter module's firmware info in [_bsm_](../examples/modbus-interface.md#model-instances)/[_VrM_](../../bauer_bsm/bsm/models/smdx_64900.xml#L58)
    - The communication module's firmware revision in [_bsm_](../examples/modbus-interface.md#model-instances)/[_VrC_](../../bauer_bsm/bsm/models/smdx_64900.xml#L66)
    - The communication module's firmware hash in the BLOB [_cfwh_](../examples/modbus-interface.md#model-instances)/[_B_](../../bauer_bsm/bsm/models/smdx_64902.xml#L25)

The meter module presents its firmware information as a combined string of
release, revision, and firmware hash. The communication module provides
revision and firmware hash separately.

The following sections contain the certified firmware releases for this meter.

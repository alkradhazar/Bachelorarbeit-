# We have a dependency to pySunSpec which is not distributed via pypi.org.
# Dependency links for having a dependency to a Git repo are deprecated so
# we've assimilated it as a submodule as follows:
#
#     1. We include it as a Git submodule under 'external'.
#
#     2. We symlink to the actual 'sunspec' module from our top-level module.
#
#     3. We've incorporated the relevant settings from pySunSpec's setup.py
#        into ours.
#
# Suggestions for improvements are welcome.
